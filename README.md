# Toxic-Tweets-Dataset-NLP-Problem
This dataset has a collection of Tweets. Its labelled as Toxic - 1, Non toxic - 0. Apply the NLP methods to predict the toxicity of the tweets.

## Libraries Used:
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: Used for implementing machine learning models, preprocessing, and metrics evaluation.
- matplotlib: Used for data visualization.
- seaborn: Used for enhanced data visualization.
- nltk: Used for natural language processing tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, and stop words removal.

## Data:
- The dataset was downloaded from the following Kaggle Com- pitation https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwiniyer176/toxic-tweets-dataset.

The script assumes that the tweet data is available in a pandas DataFrame named df with two columns:
- 'tweet': Contains the raw tweet text.
- 'Toxicity': Contains the binary label (0 for non-toxic and 1 for toxic) indicating the toxicity of each tweet.

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook, you will be able to preprocess the Toxic Tweets dataset, apply NLP methods for feature extraction, and train various classification models to predict the toxicity of tweets. The evaluation metrics obtained will help in understanding the performance of each model and selecting the most suitable one for the given classification problem.
